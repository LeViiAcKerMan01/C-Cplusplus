/*THREE RULES TO CREATE CONSTRUCTOR
1- Constructor donot have a return type.
2- NOTE:: A constuctor has the same name as the class it belongs to, i.e. a constuctor of class Employee will be called Employee only!
3- Constuctor must be public but it can be either of the three i.e. protected, private and public. Its just the requirement at this level of knowledge i am currently having!

}
//NOTE:: 
// Modified same code as in employee class in previous program!
// Many lines code is reduced to 2 line code using constructor functions!
